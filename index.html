                    As a Research Assistant in McGill's School of Social Work and Children and Families Centre for Research (CFCR), I was offered the opportunity to build
                    a website for Dr. Vandna Sinha's research group, the Children's Services Policy Research Group. This was an incredible experience 
                    and perfect blending of my two main professional interests: working with organizations that support community well-being 
                    and building websites.
